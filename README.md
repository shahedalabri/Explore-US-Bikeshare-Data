# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, we will use Python to analyze data on bike share systems from three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We will write code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions. Additionally, we will create a script that takes raw input to provide an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. 

Bike Share Data: Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have grown in number and popularity in cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bicycles for short periods for a fee. This makes it possible for people to borrow a bike at one location and return it at another, or they can return it to the same location if they want to go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve multiple users per day.
